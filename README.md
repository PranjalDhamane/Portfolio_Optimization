## Features

### Single Ticker Analysis
- Calculate essential metrics, including Expected Annual Return, Volatility, Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Jensen’s Alpha, and Value at Risk (VaR).
- Visualize stock price data with interactive candlestick and volume charts.

### Multi-Ticker Portfolio Optimization
- Optimize portfolios using Monte Carlo simulations to balance risk and return.
- Display the **Efficient Frontier** to visualize optimal risk-return profiles.
- Provide optimal portfolio weights for maximizing the Sharpe ratio.
- Show individual candlestick charts for each stock in the portfolio.

## Key Metrics

The app calculates and displays several critical financial metrics:
1. **Expected Annual Return**: Annualized return estimate based on historical data.
2. **Volatility**: Indicates the risk or variability of returns.
3. **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures return relative to risk using standard deviation.
4. **Treynor Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric using beta as the risk measure.
5. **Jensen’s Alpha**: Assesses excess return over expected return based on portfolio beta.
6. **Beta**: Measures sensitivity of the portfolio to market movements.
7. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Estimates potential portfolio losses under normal market conditions.

## Financial Metrics Explained

### Performance Metrics
- **Expected Annual Return**: Annualized average of daily returns over the selected period.
- **Volatility**: Annualized standard deviation of daily returns, representing risk.

### Risk-Adjusted Metrics
1. **Sharpe Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
   \]
   Where \( R_p \) is portfolio return, \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate, and \( \sigma_p \) is portfolio volatility.
   
2. **Treynor Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Treynor Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\beta}
   \]
   Uses portfolio beta instead of volatility for risk.

3. **Jensen’s Alpha**:
   \[
   \text{Alpha} = R_p - [R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f)]
   \]
   Indicates excess returns over expected market-based returns.

### Volatility and Risk
1. **Standard Deviation**: Reflects portfolio return variability; higher values imply greater risk.
2. **Beta**: Measures sensitivity to market trends, with \( \beta > 1 \) indicating higher market volatility.
3. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Estimates potential loss in portfolio value under normal market conditions.

### Portfolio Efficiency
- **Efficient Frontier**: Illustrates portfolios that maximize return for a given level of risk.
